# Splunk investigation Capture The Flag

## Objective


This Detection Lab project we will investigate host-centric logs in this challenge room to find suspicious process execution.
One of the clientâ€™s IDS indicated a potentially suspicious process execution indicating one of the hosts from the HR department was compromised. 
Some tools related to network information gathering / scheduled tasks were executed which confirmed the suspicion. 
Due to limited resources, we could only pull the process execution logs with Event ID: 4688 and ingested them into Splunk with the index win_eventlogs for further investigation.

## Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs through commands.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of lolbins and windows processess.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

## Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis-SPLUNK
- Incident response playbook
